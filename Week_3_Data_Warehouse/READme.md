### OLTP & OLAP
|   | OLTP | OLAP |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Control and run essential business operations in real time | Plan, solve problems, support decisions, discover hidden insights |
| Data updates | Short, fast updates initiated by user | Data periodically refreshed with scheduled, long-running batch jobs |
| Database design | Normalized databases for efficiency | Denormalized databases for analysis |
| Space requirements | Generally small if historical data is archived | Generally large due to aggregating large datasets |
| Backup and recovery | Regular backups required to ensure business continuity and meet legal and governance requirements | Lost data can be reloaded from OLTP database as needed in lieu of regular backups |
| Productivity | Increases productivity of end users | Increases productivity of business managers, data analysts and executives |
| Data view | Lists day-to-day business transactions | Multi-dimensional view of enterprise data |
| User examples | Customer-facing personnel, clerks, online shoppers | Knowledge workers such as data analysts, business analysts and executives |

### BigQuery

BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless cloud data warehouse provided by Google Cloud. It enables organizations to analyze and query large datasets in real-time using SQL-like queries. BigQuery is designed for high-performance and scalability, allowing users to process massive amounts of data quickly and cost-effectively. It supports both real-time data streaming and batch processing, making it a powerful tool for analytics, business intelligence, and data exploration in a cloud environment.

- Serverless data warehouse
  - There are no servers to manage or database software to install
- Software as well as infrastructure including
  - **scalability** and **high-availability**
- Built-in features like
  - machine learning
  - geospatial analysis
  - business intelligence
- BigQuery maximizes flexibility by separating the compute engine that analyzes your data from your storage
- On demand pricing
  - 1 TB of data processed is \$5
- Flat rate pricing
  - Based on number of pre requested slots
  - 100 slots → \$2,000/month = 400 TB data processed on demand pricing
 


### Data Warehouse

A Data Warehouse (DW) is designed as an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) solution primarily for reporting and data analysis. In contrast to Data Lakes, which adhere to the Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) model, Data Warehouses commonly employ the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) model, as explained in lesson 2.

In the ETL process, a Data Warehouse gathers data from various sources, undergoes processing in a staging area, and is then loaded into the actual warehouse, typically a database, where it is organized according to requirements. Data Warehouses may also distribute data to separate Data Marts, which are smaller database systems that end users can utilize for specific purposes.

## BigQuery queries
```sql
-- Query public available table
SELECT station_id, name FROM
    bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_stations
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- Creating external table referring to gcs path
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2019-*.csv', 'gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2020-*.csv']
);
```

```sql
-- Check yello trip data
SELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata limit 10;
```

```sql
-- Create a non partitioned table from external table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_non_partitoned AS
SELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;
```

```sql
-- Create a partitioned table from external table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitoned
PARTITION BY
  DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) AS
SELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;
```

```sql
-- Impact of partition
-- Scanning 1.6GB of data
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_non_partitoned
WHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2019-06-30';
```

```sql
-- Scanning ~106 MB of DATA
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitoned
WHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2019-06-30';
```

```sql
-- Let's look into the partitons
SELECT table_name, partition_id, total_rows
FROM `nytaxi.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS`
WHERE table_name = 'yellow_tripdata_partitoned'
ORDER BY total_rows DESC;
```

```sql
-- Creating a partition and cluster table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitoned_clustered
PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime)
CLUSTER BY VendorID AS
SELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;
```

```sql
-- Query scans 1.1 GB
SELECT count(*) as trips
FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitoned
WHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  AND VendorID=1;
```

```sql
-- Query scans 864.5 MB
SELECT count(*) as trips
FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitoned_clustered
WHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  AND VendorID=1;
```
