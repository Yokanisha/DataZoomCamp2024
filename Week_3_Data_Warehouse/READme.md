### OLTP & OLAP
|   | OLTP | OLAP |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Control and run essential business operations in real time | Plan, solve problems, support decisions, discover hidden insights |
| Data updates | Short, fast updates initiated by user | Data periodically refreshed with scheduled, long-running batch jobs |
| Database design | Normalized databases for efficiency | Denormalized databases for analysis |
| Space requirements | Generally small if historical data is archived | Generally large due to aggregating large datasets |
| Backup and recovery | Regular backups required to ensure business continuity and meet legal and governance requirements | Lost data can be reloaded from OLTP database as needed in lieu of regular backups |
| Productivity | Increases productivity of end users | Increases productivity of business managers, data analysts and executives |
| Data view | Lists day-to-day business transactions | Multi-dimensional view of enterprise data |
| User examples | Customer-facing personnel, clerks, online shoppers | Knowledge workers such as data analysts, business analysts and executives |

### BigQuery

BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless cloud data warehouse provided by Google Cloud. It enables organizations to analyze and query large datasets in real-time using SQL-like queries. BigQuery is designed for high-performance and scalability, allowing users to process massive amounts of data quickly and cost-effectively. It supports both real-time data streaming and batch processing, making it a powerful tool for analytics, business intelligence, and data exploration in a cloud environment.

- Serverless data warehouse
  - There are no servers to manage or database software to install
- Software as well as infrastructure including
  - **scalability** and **high-availability**
- Built-in features like
  - machine learning
  - geospatial analysis
  - business intelligence
- BigQuery maximizes flexibility by separating the compute engine that analyzes your data from your storage
- On demand pricing
  - 1 TB of data processed is \$5
- Flat rate pricing
  - Based on number of pre requested slots
  - 100 slots â†’ \$2,000/month = 400 TB data processed on demand pricing
